# Healthcare and Disability Insurance

Clef’s priorities with benefits are wellness and education, so it’s important that we offer our employees great medical coverage and disability insurance.

We offer medical, dental, and vision coverage at Clef for employees and their dependents. Through TriNet, many plans are available to all employees, and Clef has chosen a baseline plan for which it contributes 85% of the cost for all employee policies and 50% for dependents. The available plans range in cost, and if employees choose a plan that is more expensive than the baseline plan, they will be responsible for the difference. All employees are eligible for coverage on the first of the month following their hire date. These policies are all managed through TriNet, which is where you can find more details about the plans, costs, and coverage.

All employees receive Short Term Disability Insurance and Long Term Disability Insurance. All employees are also covered by Death and Dismemberment Insurance coverage at one times earnings (with some age restrictions that start at age 65).

Clef offers a medical waiver allowance of $25 per month for employees who have other medical coverage and choose to waive medical coverage through TriNet.
