# Mission Statement

## Our mission is to empower everyone to own their identity online.

We build a secure standard of identity for businesses to replace passwords, allowing users to have an authentic and personal relationship with the technology they use. Our core values guide our strategies and individual actions so that we create a company whose character is as radical as our product.
